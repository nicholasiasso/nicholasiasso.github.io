# The Bifurcation Diagram

Welcome to my first post! In the first post here, I'll explain the math and code behind the following fractal, called the bifurcation diagram.

## The Logistic Map

The bifurcation diagram is really an illustration of a concept called **Period Doubling**. This is a phenomenon which occurs in nature in countless ways, including the dripping of water, flowing of fluids, electrical circuits, and population sizes. It's based around iterating some function $ f(x) $


The basis of this fractal is a simple equation, called the logistic map.

$$ f(x_{n+1}) = rx_{n}(1-x_{n}) $$

This is a picture test.
